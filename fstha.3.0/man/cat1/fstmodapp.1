EXAMPLES
        Example 1: Create a builtin application monitor for apache:

        example1# fstmodapp -x 0 -v 1 -F apache -c 5


        Example 2: Create a builtin application monitor for oracle:

        example2# fstmodapp -x 1 -v 2 -F oracle -a PRODdb -c 2


        Example 3: Create a custom application monitor whose name is MyApp,
                   belonging to virtual host number 2:

        example3# fstmodapp -x 0 -s /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/start \
                                -o /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/stop \
                                -t /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/test \
                           -v 2 \
                           -n MyApp


        Example 4: Change MyApp's stop script:

        example4# fstmodapp -x 0 -s /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/start \
                                -o /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/stop.new \
                                -t /opt/FSTha/vh/MyHost/MyApp/test \
                           -v 2 \
                           -n MyApp
