NAME

        fstmodvh - modify virtual host attributes

SYNOPSIS
        fstmodvh <OPTIONS>

DESCRIPTION
        The fstmodvh is used to change virtual host attributes 
        including adding network or file system resources.

OPTIONS
        The following are supported:

        -x #       REQUIRED. There are four virtual hosts per cluster
                   numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3. Use this option to specify
                   which.

         -d dir    OPTIONAL. Change or define virtualhost's base
                   directory.

         -n name   OPTIONAL. Change or define virtualhost's name.

         -f node#  OPTIONAL. Specify a node to fallback to when node
                   becomes available. The default is neither.

         -t node#  OPTIONAL. Specify a node to fail to if node is
                   available at time of failover. The default is neither.


	 NETWORK Setup options are OPTIONAL but all are required if used:

         -1 nic    The Primary Network Interface. If not using IP
                   Multipathing, then this can be a logical interface,
                   e.g. eri0:1

         -2 nic    The Alternate Network Interface. If not using IP
                   Multipathing, then this can be a logical interface,
                   e.g. eri0:2

         -m mask   The Netmask, e.g. 255.255.255.0

         -b addr   The Broadcast Address, e.g. 192.168.1.255

         -i addr   Specify the IP address without multipathing.
                      OR
         -I addr   Specify the IP address with IP Multipathing.
                   With multipathing, the two consecutive IP addresses
                   following will be used. For example, if you specify
                   192.168.1.10 then 192.168.1.11 an 192.168.1.2 will
                   be used as dummy address. Care should be used.


	 FILE SYSTEM Setup options are OPTIONAL but all are required if used:

         -D dev   The device to mount, e.g. /dev/dsk/c1t1d0s0

         -R rdev  The raw device to fsck, e.g. /dev/rdsk/c1t1d0s0

         -F type  The file system type, e.g. ufs, vxfs

         -M dir   The mount point, e.g. /MyDirectory




EXAMPLES
        Example 1: Create a virtual host whose name is WEB as
                   virtual host number 1.

        example# fstaddvh -x 1 -d /opt/FSTha/vh/WEB -n WEB 
        example# fstmodvh -x 1 -f 0 \
                          -1 le0:1 -2 le0:2 -i 192.168.1.11 \
                          -m 255.255.255.0 -b 192.168.1.255


        Example 2: Change virtual host number 0's name to YourHost

        example# fstmodvh -x 0 -b /opt/FSTha/vh/YourHost -n YourHost

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
        The PATH environment variable must include /opt/FSTha/bin

EXIT STATUS
        The following exit values are returned:

        0     Command completed successfully.

        >0    An error occurred.
