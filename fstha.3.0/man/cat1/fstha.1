DESCRIPTION
        The fstha command provides control over the status of the cluster,
        where the virtual hosts are mastered and whether the application
        monitors are turned on, off or not checked.

        By default (if no command is supplied), fstha will print the 
        status of the cluster. Valid commands are:

        bootup
            Start the cluster on the first node that creates the cluster. 
            This command can only be run on the first node to establish
            the cluster (after all nodes have left the cluster).

        startup
            Run this command on a node that is joining the existing
            cluster. Once started, this node will sync it's configuration
            database from an existing node. Node 0 will be attempted first
            followed by a sync to Node 1, then 2 and 3 until a sucessful
            sync up occurs.

        shutdown
            Bring this node out of the cluster. Any virtual host mastered
            on this node will be brought down first. Once all nodes have
            executed this command, the cluster is down.
 
        status
            This command will print a status update once per second.

        export
            Dump the contents of the cluster configuration database.

        backup
            Copy the contents of the cluster configuration database.

        locate
            Bring virtual host numbered by VH# up on Node# or bring
            bring VH# down by specifying 'N'.

        nocheck
            Disable application testing for App# of virtual host VH#.

        on
            Turn application App# of virtual host VH# on. Run the start
            script and enable testing.

        off
            Turn application App# of virtual host VH# off. Disable
            testing and run the stop script.
