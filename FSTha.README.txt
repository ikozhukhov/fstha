Notes:

HA/FST began as a project because at that time there weren't
any free solutions that provided high availability with the
features that I needed. I developed it with intentions of only
myself seeing the source code. As a result, some code segments
lack comments and there are obvious places were a function would
be better than the repeating code, common libraries, etc.

HA/FST was written for Solaris 8 and above. Product binaries can
be found at http://www.fstha.com.

Donations can be made at http://www.fstha.com/donate
